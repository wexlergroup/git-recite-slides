## What is version control

Version control (also known as revision control, source control, and source code management) is the software engineering practice of controlling computer files and versions of files; primarily source code text files, but generally any type of file. ^[<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control>]

. . .

- it's a concept, and `Git` is a software
- and [GitHub](https://github.com/) is a platform/host/server...

## What is `Git`

- it's a software
- it's free and open source
- it's the  *de facto* standard version control system but there are many more (both open and proprietary)
- it's independent of network access or a central server


## What is [GitHub](https://github.com/)?

- it's a platform/host/server...
- it's free but **NOT** open source
- it's owned by Microsoft since 2018
- there are many others, e.g., [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/product), [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com)

## The components

There are the local part and the serve part

  node [ fontname="Handlee" ];
  subgraph cluster_frontend {
    label="your laptop";
    "local files" -> "local repo"
  }
      
  subgraph cluster_backend {
    
    label="the internet";
    "online repo";
  }

  "local repo" -> "online repo";
  
}
```
