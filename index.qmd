## What is version control

Version control (also known as revision control, source control, and source code management) is the software engineering practice of controlling computer files and versions of files; primarily source code text files, but generally any type of file. ^[<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control>]

. . .

- it's a concept, and `Git` is a software
- and [GitHub](https://github.com/) is a platform/host/server...

## What is `Git`

- it's a software
- it's free and open source
- it's the  *de facto* standard version control system but there are many more (both open and proprietary)
- it's independent of network access or a central server


## What is [GitHub](https://github.com/)?

- it's a platform/host/server...
- it's free but **NOT** open source
- it's owned by Microsoft since 2018
- there are many others, e.g., [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/product), [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com)

## The components

There are the local parts and the server part. Typically, you interact with all parts through the command line interface (CLI), which contains a set of text-based instructions.

Nowadays, there are graphical user interfaces (GUIs) available for your convenience. Many integrated development environments (IDEs) also have integrated git functionalities, either built-in ot via plug-ins.


## The direction of version control: `pull`
```{dot}
digraph A {
  rankdir=LR;
  edge [ style=dashed ];

  // node [ fontname="Handlee" ];
  subgraph cluster_frontend {
    label="Your Laptop";
    "local files" -> "staging area" -> "local repo" [dir=back];
  }
      
  subgraph cluster_backend {
    
    label="The Internet (origin/remote)";
    "online repo";
  }

  "local repo" -> "online repo" [dir=back];
  
}
```

<span style="font-size:0.5em;">Repo: repository</span>

## The direction of version control: `push`

```{dot}
digraph B {
  rankdir=LR;
  edge [ style=dashed ];

  // node [ fontname="Handlee" ];
  subgraph cluster_frontend {
    label="Your Laptop";
    "local files" ->"staging area" -> "local repo";
  }
      
  subgraph cluster_backend {
    
    label="The Internet (origin/remote)";
    "online repo";
  }

  "local repo" -> "online repo";
  
}
```

<span style="font-size:0.5em;">Repo: repository</span>

# Commands

## Setting up a repository



## To start tracking

- `git add`: to stage the changes
```bash
git add <file_name>
```
several options:
```bash
git add -A    # stage all changes: new, modified and deleted files
git add .     # stage new and modified files
git add -u    # stage modified and deleted files
```

## To stage the changes
- `git commit`: to commit the changes staged with `git add`
```bash
git commit -m "some text for the commit message"
```
